I’ve got ubelievably good reasons to eventually learn ruby. My motivations may be subject to a future post, but for now, I will document the different steps used.

### Install RVM
Don’t know which one inspired the other between NVM and RVM, but they both work similarly. Of course the goal of RVM is providing the ability to switch easily between different ruby versions. 
You’ll find all you need here: (https://rvm.io/rvm/install). 
After following the instructions, I got the error you can see on the screenshot
Apparently, RVM sets all it needs into ~/.profile, so that you have to logout/login to see it in action

Rails:

rails new => new projet
rails server => launch new project into server
rails generate => scafolding
