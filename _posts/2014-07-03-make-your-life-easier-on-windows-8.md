Even though I've been a hardcore Linux user since a dozen years, I must admit that I enjoy Windows 8 !  
Here are some tips to make it even better !
## Install a real console ##
Windows console is a pain in the ass to use, and Microsoft engineers didn't feel the need to change it since Windows 3.1, back in the mid 1990's !  
I can understand that Windows is targeted to non-technical users, but still why didn't they make a usable console ? By chance there's a brilliant open source alternative: [ConEmu](http://sourceforge.net/projects/conemu).  
This is an incredible tool, allowing you to use tabs, to open cmd, powershell or putty sessions, and far, far more features !

## Install a real system variables editor ##
I don't know for you but I've always been swearing while editing Windows path. Yes the interface comes directly from 1995 too... Again, a wonderful tool is gonna make your life much easier: [Rapid Environment Editor](http://www.rapidee.com/en/about)
